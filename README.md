I am a Make It Work Software Engineering student at the HvA.

In my younger years I started coding in basic and ASP. From 2000 to 2004 I worked at an advertising agency, where I created websites.

In 2018 I started with coding again, this time in PHP. Using the Scriptcase software (low code), I made a planning program for flexible scheduling of catering staff, which is now used by more than 100 users.

At the moment I am learning Java and Spring framework.
