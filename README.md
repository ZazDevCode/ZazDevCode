ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sascha Wernars
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in PHP and MySQL
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the PHP framework Laravel
ðŸ“« Contact met at s@scha.nl

I am a hobby programmer and I am currently immersing myself in the PHP Laravel framework. 

In my younger years I programmed in visual basic and ASP. From 2000 to 2004 I worked at an advertising agency, where I made websites.

In 2018 I started programming again, this time in PHP. Using the Scriptcase software, I made a planning program for flexible scheduling of catering staff.

After getting more acquainted with Laravel, I plan to recreate this software and expand my skills further.
