👋 Hi, I’m Sascha Wernars
👀 I’m interested in PHP and MySQL
🌱 I’m currently learning the PHP framework Laravel
📫 Contact met at s@scha.nl

I am a hobby software developer and I am currently immersing myself in the PHP Laravel framework. 

In my younger years I started in visual basic and ASP. From 2000 to 2004 I worked at an advertising agency, where I created websites.

In 2018 I started with software development again, this time in PHP. Using the Scriptcase software (low code), I made a planning program for flexible scheduling of catering staff.

After getting more acquainted with Laravel, I plan to recreate this software and expand my skills further.
